  Manuscripts are associated with a rich description which needs to be cataloged
  for preservation and ease of accessibility in a comprehensible format. One of
  the complexities of cataloging manuscripts is attributed to the available
  standards which are usually not tight to fit for a specific data model.
  Another aspect is that those thousand-year old manuscripts were written using
  old forms of languages that cannot be made searchable using current tools.
  Bibliotheca Alexandrina (BA) has designed and implemented a new approach for
  facilitating the cataloging, searching and viewing of collections of ancient
  Arabic manuscripts, provided by Wellcome Trust. Those manuscripts contain
  special characters that were used for representing Arabic language at the
  time. Our approach imposes building a structured schema-compliant records that
  fits the desired data model. The schema drives an authoring tool, which
  generates records with the desired structure via its automatically generated
  human friendly metadata forms. The generated records are checked against the
  selected standard to insure compliance, which follows in our use case the TEI
  P5 standard. The new approach is flexible in the sense that changes to the
  data model are seamlessly reflected to the structure of the records, and
  generates forms without the need for adding or editing a single line of code.
  The approach also provides a solution for both cataloging using old characters
  and searching manuscripts using modern and old characters. Our open source
  solution is generic, flexible, scalable, extensible and can be adopted by
  systems for any standard and any language. It allows searching, viewing,
  comparing and downloading the manuscripts.
